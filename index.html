                <p class="wc">
                    Gradually, China is heading toward a technologically advanced future as it’s currently the world’s second largest economy. Being one of the world’s most innovative nations, it is also a place of large political and societal interest as its migrant population increases at a rate of over a hundred thousand every year. Understandably so, as China is one of the world’s most populous countries with a heaping 18% of the world’s population living there. It is also one of the world's biggest countries with an amazingly interesting history and a rich culture with fascinating traditions. Its 9.6 million square kilometre surface area covers a whopping five geographical time zones and borders 14 countries.</p>

                <p class="wc">This delightfully big land is filled with famous sights and charming friendly citizens. The people of China proudly celebrate their engaging history and traditions through many different festivals and holidays, famously the Spring Festival and Chinese New Year, also known as the Lunar festival. Not to mention the huge variety of delicious food and ancient medicine that around 65.7 million tourists travel from all around the world to China for. And variety is something you get in every sense of the word in China, as it also applies to their climate, their sights and their people, who are all part of the foundation of one of the world’s fourth most travelled countries.</p>

                    <p class="sdec"><b>The Spring Festival</b> is a festival that begins on the first day in the first month of the lunar calendar and ends on the 15th with a festival where the residents will hang lanterns on their door and set off firecrackers, it is their type of new year celebration. In preparation for this the Chinese people start by cleaning their houses, shopping, cooking and more. One big reason as to why it is so important to them is that they get to meet close ones who live far away. When they meet, the young ones get to show off their new clothes and give best wishes and a toast to the elders' health and happiness and in return the young ones will be rewarded money. To understand it better, the Spring Festival to the Chinese people is what Christmas is to us. There are however a few certain things to avoid if you do not want bad luck, like certain words and behaviors.</p>

The Chinese dialects are among the world’s most ancient languages. The biggest dialect is Standard Mandarin as it is spoken by circa one billion citizens. First the Chinese were writing on plates made of wood and later on they invented paper. And what's so special about the language is that they use the same alphabet that they used five thousand years ago.</p>

The pre-china period saw the formation of language with science and technology that they used with great intelligence and diversity. 
                        A big part of the culture is mostly about finding the balance between yin and yang and with yin and yang finding harmony. A larger part of Chinese culture is that it is based on a spiritual world, which means that they believe there is a spiritual world. Another big part of Chinese culture is the martial arts because china is the original birth place of eastern martial arts. The most common martial art is kung fu or first name wushu. The first generation of art's purpose is more about survival and warfare than art even though some art have retained a distinct Chinese flavor.
